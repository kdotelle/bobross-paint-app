## Functionality
This is a freeform paint canvas.  Users have the ability to change the brush size, choose a color from a drag and drop color picker or input a HEX or RGB code, and erase brush strokes.  The color, brush, and erase functionality is located in a collapsable drawer that users can close to increase the canvas size. On the main Canvas there are controls to undo brush strokes and clear the entire canvas to blank.
